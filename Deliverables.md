# I appreciated how both Azure and Google Cloud have built in tools for tracking and monitoring costs of a project.  It seems like they even go so far as to provide recommendations to optimize your projects and lower expenses.  I assume this helps them as well by lowering their  resource use but this does really help the user as well.  The ability to send alerts at predesignated hbudget thresholds looks like it could be a life saver for paying customers.  Although my newly created bare-bones budgets didnt garner any recommendations, I assume a more robust budget would have received numerous recommendations for how to acheive my goals.
